# pytorch-exploration
Exploration of using pytorch for model fitting

## Environment setup

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
pip install pytorch-forecasting
```

If you have an existing `torchexp` environment that you want to update to match changes in `environment.yml`, you can do so with the following command:

```
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```
